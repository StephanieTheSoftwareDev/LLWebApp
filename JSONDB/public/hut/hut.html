                            A fanciful mark gains the most protection because it was invented solely to serve as a trademark and has no other
                            meaning. Examples are “Google” and “Uber.”
                            <br><br>
                            These words are typically unknown or completely outside of common usage.

                            Arbitrary marks are also strong. These words are common but are used in an uncommon way, and do not describe or suggest
                            the product or service.
                            <br><br>
                            An example is “Apple” to describe computers.

                            Suggestive marks require people to imagine what the nature of a product or service might be.
                            <br>
                            For example, “Microsoft”
                            suggests software, but it is not a literal description of it.

                            Descriptive marks are those that clearly describe a product or service, and no additional thought or imagination is
                            required to determine what the product or service is.
                            <br><br>
                            Descriptive marks are weak and do not qualify for trademark
                            protection, unless a secondary meaning has developed over time. An example is “Smith’s Plumbing.”

                            Generic marks are terms that cannot be used as trademarks. For example, “email” would be a generic mark.
                            <br><br>
                            Trademarks can
                            become generic if the public misuses the mark to generally identify goods or services.

            <p class="helpYourself">Before selecting a mark, you should determine whether you can register it with the United States Patent and Trademark
            Office. Business owners invest time and money building the reputation associated with the trademark. For this reason,
            failure to do a comprehensive trademark search at the beginning of operations is unwise. Someone else might already
            have rights in a trademark that is similar to a name you are considering for your product or service, and if you fail
            to do a search, you take a risk that you will receive a notice from such trademark owner that demands that you stop
            using the trademark and start over. Further, you could be served with a lawsuit and need to hire an attorney, which can
            be very time consuming and costly. By conducting a trademark search ahead of time, you protect your company's
            investment in building the brand.</p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h5 class="h5Class"><span class="boldedSpan">Conduct a Trademark Search</span></h5>
            <br>
            <p class="helpYourself">Search federal, state, and online databases to make sure someone else does not already have rights to use your proposed
                mark. A federal search can be done for free on the USPTO website using the Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS)
                here: <a href="http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=tess&state=4804:501x3z.1.1">tmsearch.USPTO.gov</a>
                When a trademark is federally registered with the USPTO, a court will assume the defendant knew it was federally
                registered. A defendant may be required to pay damages and the trademark owner's attorney's fees.
                In many states, the trademark database is part of the Secretary of State's office, but in some states, it is a
                separate department. In CA, info can be found here: <a href="https://www.sos.ca.gov/business-programs/ts/">sos.ca.gov</a>
                
                It is also a good idea to search for unregistered trademarks via a basic online Google search to see if anyone is
                using
                the mark for a similar purpose. You may conduct a basic domain search here: <a href="https://whois.icann.org/en">WHOIS.ICANN.org</a>
                </p>

            <h5 class="h5Class"><span class="boldedSpan">Use in Commerce Reqs</span></h5>
            <br>
            <p class="helpYourself">
                Basic rights in the trademark are created simply by using the trademark in business. This use must be in alignment
                with
                trademark law, such as exercising "good faith." The USPTO also allows trademark filings for an ‘intent-to-use’
                application, when the company is planning on using the mark in the future. This can be helpful for a startup or
                entrepreneur.

            <br><br><br><br>
            <p class="helpYourself">Ownership of a mark gives the owner the right to exclude others from using similar marks if those marks may cause
            confusion. The laws surrounding unregistered marks are derived from principles of unfair competition or unfair
            business. Specifically, it is considered unfair for somebody to trade on the goodwill you have built up around a mark
            in order to sell competing goods or services.
            <br><br><br>
            Using a trademark in commerce gives you rights under “common law." This means that you may be able to stop others from
            using your mark if they started using it after you, and if they are selling similar products or services. Unregistered
            marks are protected within a particular geographic area and reasonable extensions only.
            <br><br><br>
            You can claim trademark rights
            in your unregistered trademark as long as it is distinctive and identifies or distinguishes your products or services.
            A trade name for your business is not the same as an unregistered trademark and is not given the same protections under
            federal trademark law.

            <h2 class="thePageHeader">Benefits of Registering a Trademark</h2>
            <br><br><br><br>
            <p class="helpYourself">
                A trademark is a form of intellectual property, an asset that adds value to a business.
                Registration can become valuable after a business grows, even if the value is not immediately apparent.
                <br><br><br>
                There are numerous advantages to registering a trademark including nationwide protection, ability to file a lawsuit against an
                infringer in federal court, incontestable status after five years of registration, presumption of ownership, enhanced
                remedies, and constructive notice of ownership to others around the nation. Incontestability can be helpful because a
                trademark cannot be attacked for being merely “descriptive,” even if it is.
                <br><br><br>
                Registration may also help when fighting
                for a domain name. The trademark owner can use the registration as a basis for registration abroad, and file the
                registration with the U.S. Customs Service to stop others from importing infringing foreign goods.

            <p class="helpYourself">
                Visit the USPTO website to learn more and take steps to file. See: <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-getting-started/trademark-basics">USPTO.gov</a>

                <br>
                <p class="helpYourself">
                After submission, an examiner will review your application. If the examiner denies your application, you will have six
                months to reply or amend it. The application will then be reexamined.
                <br><br>
                This process may be repeated until the examiner issues a final refusal or you do not reply, amend, or appeal. If an examiner
                approves the application, it will be published in the Official Gazette of the USPTO.
                <br><br>
                This gives others the opportunity to oppose the mark. Others may oppose it if they are using a similar mark and believe your mark will dilute theirs. The person 
                or entity opposing registration will need to show likelihood of damage if your mark is registered.
                <br><br>
                A notice of registration will be published in the Official Gazette. Others have five years after your trademark is registered to file a petition to have
                such registration canceled.

                <br>
                <p class="helpYourself">As soon as you claim your right in a particular mark, you can use the &trade; (trademark) or &#8480; (service mark) symbol.
                However, you can only use the federal registration symbol of &reg; if the USPTO registers the mark, and the symbol with the
                mark can then only be used in connection with the goods or services that the USPTO lists in the trademark registration.
